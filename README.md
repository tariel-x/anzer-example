# Anzer examples

The repository contains scheme of functions composition and
example implementations of the functions.

See [the main repo](https://github.com/tariel-x/anzer/) to
find out how to deploy the scheme. Note that files are
semi-generated and any manual change in `TypeIn`/`TypeOut` structure
will lead to deploy failure.
